## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to query a MySQL database of t-shirt inventory using natural language questions. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to interpret and respond to user queries with relevant SQL-generated answers.

## Features

- **Natural Language Querying:** Translates user questions into SQL queries using Google Palm.
- **Efficient Database Interaction:** Uses Chroma vector store and Few-Shot learning for efficient and context-aware querying.
- **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Generates SQL prompts based on user input and database schema.
- **Interactive UI:** Provides a responsive and user-friendly interface with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Natural Language Processing:** Google Palm, Hugging Face Transformers, Langchain
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Machine Learning:** Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Means Clustering
- **Database & Data Analysis:** SQL (MySQL), SQLAlchemy
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Other Tools:** Chroma, Selenium, dotenv

## Project Structure

- `langchain_helper.py`: Contains the main function to create and configure the Few-Shot SQLDatabaseChain.
- `main.py`: Streamlit application that takes user input and displays the query results.
- `few_shots.py`: Example questions, queries, and results for Few-Shot learning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atliq-tshirts-database-qa.git
    cd atliq-tshirts-database-qa
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
    - Add your Google API key in the `.env` file:
    ```plaintext
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    ```

5. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app in your web browser.
2. Enter a natural language question related to the t-shirt inventory.
3. The app will display the SQL query and the corresponding answer.

## Example Questions

- "How many t-shirts do we have left for Nike in XS size and white color?"
- "How much is the total price of the inventory for all S-size t-shirts?"
- "If we have to sell all the Leviâ€™s T-shirts today with discounts applied, how much revenue will our store generate?"
